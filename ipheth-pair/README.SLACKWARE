This is the original pairing program shipped with the iPhone USB Ethernet
Driver. You could also use idevicepair instead, which is shipped with latest
libimobiledevice releases. To do so, you have to modify the modprobe
configuration file /etc/modprobe.d/ipheth.conf shipped with ipheth-driver
(take a look in its doc folder) and the udev rules file
/lib/udev/rules.d/90-iphone-tether.rules shipped with this program.
