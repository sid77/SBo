IO::Socket::SSL -- Nearly transparent SSL encapsulation for IO::Socket::INET.

This module is a true drop-in replacement for IO::Socket::INET that uses SSL
to encrypt data before it is transferred to a remote server or client.
IO::Socket::SSL supports all the extra features that one needs to write a
full-featured SSL client or server application: multiple SSL contexts, cipher
selection, certificate verification, and SSL version selection. As an extra
bonus, it works perfectly with mod_perl.

In order to use IO::Socket::SSL you need to have Net::SSLeay v1.21 or later,
avalaible as Net-SSLeay from SlackBuilds.org.  This package as also an
optional dependency on libwww-perl which can be installed from SlackBuilds.org
as well.  Another optional dependency is on international domain names
handling module, it's recommended to install either Net::IDN::Encode or
Net::LibIDN. The latter is avalaible from SlackBuilds.org, if none of these
are found found, however, the library will switch to internal name resolution
routines (and prints out a big ugly WARNING at compile time ;-) ).
