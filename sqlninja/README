Sqlninja is a tool targeted to exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities on a web
application that uses Microsoft SQL Server as its back-end. Its main goal is
to provide a remote access on the vulnerable DB server, even in a very hostile
environment. It should be used by penetration testers to help automate the
process of taking over a DB Server when a SQL Injection vulnerability has been
discovered.

This version includes Raul Siles' patch for better Metasploit Framework
integration which adds two new timers ($client_delay (30 secs) and
$server_delay (5 secs)).

This requires perl-Net-DNS, perl-Net-Pcap, perl-IO-Socket-SSL, Net-SSLeay,
perl-NetPacket, and perl-Net-RawIP.
