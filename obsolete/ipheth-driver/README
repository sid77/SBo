This is a Linux Kernel driver that adds support for iPhone tethering through
USB cables. Unlike other solutions out there, you don't need to jailbreak your
phone or install third-party proxy applications.

Attention: The ipheth kernel module has been accepted upstream as of Apr 21
2010 for kernel 2.6.34.

This module is still useful if you're running the stock Slackware kernel or
the 2.6.33 tree. You still need an iPhone pairing program: this package will
configure by default a modprobe helper based on ipheth-pair, an optional
helper based on idevicepair from latest libimobiledevice releases is also
provided.

This package requires ipheth-pair.
