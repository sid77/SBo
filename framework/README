The Metasploit Framework is a development platform for creating security tools
and exploits. The framework is used by network  security professionals to
perform penetration tests, system administrators to verify patch
installations, product vendors to perform regression testing, and security
researchers world-wide. The framework is written in the Ruby programming
language and includes components written in C and assembler.

This is just a repackaged version of the installer you get from the Metasploit
download page. This is an all-in-one installer with Metasploit own versions of
Ruby, Java and PostgreSQL.

An optional cron script to keep the framework up to date is distributed inside
the /usr/doc/framework-3.5.1 directory. If you use this script, future package
updates can break your current working copy, tainting the .svn metadata. To
avoid doing so, just run "removepkg framework" and "rm -rf /opt/metasploit3",
both as root, before proceeding with the package update.
