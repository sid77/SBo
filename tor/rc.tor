# Startup/shutdown script for tor. This is a wrapper around torctl;
# torctl does the actual work in a relatively system-independent, or at least
# distribution-independent, way, and this script deals with fitting the
# whole thing into the conventions of the particular system at hand.

# This script is a modified contrib/tor.sh, for use on Slackware.
