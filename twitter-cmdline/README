It's a very simple perl program that allows for posting to twitter, and
reading your friends_timeline from twitter. It can initiate follow messages,
and it can send direct messages.

This command-line twitter client supports an arbitrary number of twitter
accounts by way of individual configuration files for each twitter account.
The default account is $HOME/.twitterrc, but an alternate can be specified on
the command-line with -f.

This package requires libwww-perl, avalaible at SlackBuilds.org.
