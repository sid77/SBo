Net::Packet - a framework to easily send and receive frames from layer 2 to
layer 7

This module is a unified framework to craft, send and receive packets at
layers 2, 3, 4 and 7.
Basically, you forge each layer of a frame (Net::Packet::IPv4 for layer 3,
Net::Packet::TCP for layer 4; for example), and pack all of this into a
Net::Packet::Frame object. Then, you can send the frame to the network, and
receive its response easily, because the response is automatically searched
for and matched against the request (not implemented for all layers).

This package requires: perl-Bit-Vector, perl-Class-Gomor, perl-Net-IPv4Addr,
perl-Net-IPv6Addr, perl-Net-Libdnet, perl-Net-Pcap, perl-Net-Write and
perl-Socket6. All of them are avalaible from SlackBuilds.org.

This is not the same module as perl-NetPacket!
