The Greenbone Security Assistant is a web application that connects 
to the OpenVAS Manager and OpenVAS Administrator to provide for a 
full-featured user interface for vulnerability management.

This package provides the Greenbone Security Assistant.  It will also 
install an init script to start the manager at system startup.

This requires openvas-libraries, openvas-scanner, openvas-client, 
openvas-administrator, openvas-manager, and libmicrohttpd.
